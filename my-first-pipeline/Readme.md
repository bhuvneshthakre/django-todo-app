# Jenkins Pipeline for Git Repository

This repository contains a Jenkins pipeline configuration that enables continuous integration and deployment for a project hosted on a Git repository. The pipeline is defined using a Jenkinsfile, which is a Groovy script that describes the steps and stages of the pipeline.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the Jenkins pipeline, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Jenkins**: Install Jenkins on your server or use a hosted Jenkins service.
2. **Git**: Ensure that Git is installed and configured on the Jenkins server.
3. **Pipeline Plugins**: Install the necessary Jenkins plugins for pipeline support. You may need plugins like "Pipeline", "Git", and others depending on your requirements.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the Jenkins pipeline for your Git repository:

1. **Create a Jenkins Job**: Create a new Jenkins job by selecting "New Item" from the Jenkins home page. Choose "Pipeline" as the job type.

2. **Configure Pipeline from SCM**: In the job configuration, scroll down to the "Pipeline" section and select "Pipeline script from SCM" as the Definition.

3. **Specify Git Repository**: In the SCM section, select "Git" and provide the URL of your Git repository.

4. **Specify Jenkinsfile**: Set the "Script Path" field to the relative path of the Jenkinsfile in your repository. For example, if your Jenkinsfile is located at the root of the repository, you can leave this field empty or specify "Jenkinsfile".

5. **Save and Run**: Save the job configuration and trigger a build to start the pipeline. Jenkins will clone the repository, find the Jenkinsfile, and execute the defined stages and steps.

## Jenkinsfile

The Jenkinsfile defines the pipeline stages and steps that Jenkins will execute. You need to create a Jenkinsfile in your repository and configure it according to your project's needs. Here's a simple example of a Jenkinsfile:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                // Add build steps here
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                // Add test steps here
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                // Add deployment steps here
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we have three stages: "Build," "Test," and "Deploy." You can add your own steps within each stage to perform the necessary actions, such as building the project, running tests, and deploying to a target environment.

Feel free to modify the Jenkinsfile according to your project's requirements.
